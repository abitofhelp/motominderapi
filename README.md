# motominder API

# Background
Motominderapi will be a RESTful API for manipulating a repository of motorcycles.  It is implemented in GO using a Clean Architecture and TDD.

This project is continuing to evolve.  The next step is to implement the web service, which is an outer ring of the Clean Architecture model.  The final step will be to persist to a database.  At this time, persistance is to a file, but it will be an easy matter to change this mechanism.

I have a long history using variants of the C programming language, and the similarities between C and GO spiked my interest in the latter.  I am a staunch advocate for test driven development and Uncle Bob's Screaming Clean Architecture.  During my sebatical between contracted software assignments, I decided to create a web service in GO that will record the maintenance events and suggest required services for a fleet of motorcycles.  Since the vast majority of the operations will manipulate textual JSON objects, a RESTful web service will be created.  I have used Google RPC ("grpc") on a  few web service projects where the it was better to send data in a binary format, rather that megabytes of JSON.  For example, on one project, I needed to draw a path on a satellite image.  This is an excellent opportunity to use a remote procedure call ("RPC") to work with the binary data in the image, so I used grpc.
